- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HarithaSindhuRajeev
-  Iâ€™m a PhD student at University of Virginia
-  My research focus on neutron/X-Ray diffraction and scattering experiments involving hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) which are potential solar cell materials.
-  I employ Density Functional Theory (DFT), to understand vibrational dynamics which includes phonon band structure and density of states calculations.
-  For DFT calculations, I utilize the VASP package, subsequently comparing the outcomes with scattering data.
-  I use MATLAB to organize, sort and analyze the scattering data.
-  I am currently interested in learning exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques using python.
